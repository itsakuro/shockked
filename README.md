# Shocked. ‚ö°

## Who I Am. üë§
Hey there. You can call me Shocked or Akuro, I make designs, games, and programs. You've probably seen me around if you have [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/-Shocked-), and I have a Twitter [account](https://twitter.com/AkuroTheWolf) aswell.

## Think, Design, Program. üíª
I have a pretty steady process for making apps‚Äîthink, design, program. This keeps it simple;
- **Step One: Think of an Idea.** This can be a hard part, especially if you're a little uncreative, like myself. If using your imagination gives you no luck, what I like to do is browse websites like Dribbble and find things I like, then twist it to be an original idea.
- **Step Two: Get Designing.** Think of how you'll make your app look, and get designing. A key thing to remember when designing is accessibility and space. Your interface should feel relaxed to give the user a nicer experience, and not to overwhelm then when they open your app. I personally use [Gravit](https://designer.io/en) to make my designs.
- **Step Two: Program & Upload.** The last bit is actually not the hardest part, if you have the experience. Program your app using your text editor or engine of choice, and finally, determine where you'll share it. I mainly share my stuff on [Itch](https://redhats.itch.io) and Scratch (PUN NOT INTENDED-), a good place to post games and apps.

## Developing the Web. üåê
As a web designer, it's important to have your place on the web make an _impact_. I use to use Webflow's free plan because I couldn't afford a plan _and_ a domain. I ditched it when I couldn't get rid of the "Made with Webflow" in the corner, and eventually found GitHub Pages, which was kinda life-changing‚ÄîNo watermark, I can code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and really do anything a regular website could do, without setbacks. I'm working on a GitHub Page right now, and you'll be able to find it at https://shockked.github.io/ ***when I add the .html***.
