# 👋 Hey!
I'm Akuro, a graphic designer, web developer, programmer, game-developer, digital artist, webcomic creator, Discord.JS programme—
...You're still here? Normally people just get bored by then.

Anyways, my current interests are
- Creating an app using a user database
- Participating in a game jam
- Finishing a game (for once)
- Making music (*good* music lmao)
